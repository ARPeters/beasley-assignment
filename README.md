==================
GitHub 'Milestones' and 'Issues' are a critical piece of our research projects. They've help coordinate many developers 
and statisticians working on a single project and code base. Communication can be enhanced learning how to include more 
than just plain text in the issues. These touches make it easier for the reader to make connections between the post 
and the code.

Item 1: Create a link that will always refer to the most current version of a file, even if the file is updated after the post.

Item 2: Create a link that will refer to a snapshot of a file. So when the file is updated, the pointer does NOT refer to the
newer version.

Item 3: Refer to a specific line of code in a snapshot of a file.

Item 4: Refer to a block of code in a snapshot of a file.

Item 5: Refer to another GitHub issue.

Item 6: Refer to another GitHub user.

Item 7: Make hide the full url of the item 1, and display just "item 1"

Item 8: Format in-line code (eg, a variable name)

Item 9: Format a block of code.

Item 10: Refer to GitHub "diff". This allows the reader to look at the red & green lines on one screen, instead of 
flipping back and forth between two versions/pages.

Item 11: Create 'tasks' within an issue. GitHub released an extension to their version of markdown. It allows you to 
create a list of 'tasks' within an issue. https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments
